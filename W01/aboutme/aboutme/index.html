    <h2>Anderson Oritz Dias Junior</h2>
    <p>
      I am 22 years old, married with a wounderful wife and a big fan o Brandon
      Sanderson and DnD.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently an intern IOS developer at CI&T but my dream carreer is to
      become a game developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I chose BYUI because studying in english will prepare me for an
      international carreer (I'm Brazilian, so my first language is portuguese)
      and because I love the comfort of studying from home.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know web design will be important for me because it can helps me to find
      a lot of jobs as a developer untill he day I'll be able to start coding
      games.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've been a member of the Church since I was born and served a mission in
      Bras√≠lia,the capital of Brazil. My favorite scripture is the second
      chapter of the book of 2 Nephi.
