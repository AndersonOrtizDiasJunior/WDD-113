      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>
       <h3>Born by necessity</h3>
As someone who suffers with diabetes and lactose intolerance, Deborah always had a hard time trying to find sweetness in her life.
No matter how hard she tried, it was almost impossible to find good diet desserts and lactose free deserts, and when she found they usually had no variety.
Trying to find good diet products was so hard and frustrating that one day she realized:
“If I want elegant, diversified, and delicious diet sweets, I will have to do them myself. ”
So she studied Gastronomy in the Senac Limeira, one of the most well recognized cooking schools in Brazil, and started to create her own recipes.
But, after a while, she realized that wasn’t enough, she was not the only who needed her recipes.
“It was not fair” - she remember thinking - “to keep that secrets for myself, I need to give other people like me an opportunity to find good desserts”.
By this passionate study and this strong desire the Deborah’s patissierie was born.

<h3>Cooking for everyone</h3>
After starting her diet products, she perceived the diabetics were not the only ones needing sweetness, so in 2035, Deborah created her first gluten free recipes.
She keep innovating until today, and know Deborah’s have pastries for more than 10 types of allergy, intolerance or restrictions. And this number will only keep growing.
