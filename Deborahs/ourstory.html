                        <h3>Born by necessity</h3>
                        <p>As someone who suffers from diabetes and lactose intolerance, Deborah has always had trouble finding anything sweet in her life. No matter how hard she tried, it was nearly impossible to find good diet and lactose-free desserts, and when she did find some, they usually lacked variety. <br>
                            The search for good diet products was so difficult and frustrating that one day she realized, "If I want elegant, varied and delicious diet sweets, I have to make them myself." So she studied gastronomy at Senac Limeira, one of Brazil's most recognized culinary schools, and began creating her own recipes. <br>
                            After a while, she realized that was not enough, because she was not the only one who needed her recipes. "It was not fair" - she recalls - "to keep these secrets to myself, I need to give other people like me the opportunity to find good desserts". <br>
                            Through this passionate study and strong desire, Deborah's Patisserie was born.</p>

                        <h3>Cooking for everyone</h3>
                        <p>After launching her diet products, she realised that diabetics were not the only ones who needed sweets, so in 2035 Deborah developed her first gluten-free sweets. <br>
                            To date, she has continued to develop new recipes and Deborah's now offers pastries for more than 10 types of allergies, intolerances or restrictions. And that number will continue to grow.</p>
